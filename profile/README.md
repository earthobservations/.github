# Earth Observations

We are a group of likeminded people creating tools to access earth data related to
- weather
- hydrology
- environment

free of charge and in multiple ways to reduce the hassle of writing
data feeds adapted to the various shapes that data is provided by agencies.

We want you to be able to receive a simple pandas DataFrame with all the information needed
to start your next analysis!
